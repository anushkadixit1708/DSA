//Given an unsorted array of size n. Array elements are in the range from 1 to n. One number from set {1, 2, â€¦n} is missing and one number occurs twice in the array. 
//Find these two numbers.

//Approach - Traverse the array. While traversing, use the absolute value of every element as an index and make the value at this index as negative to mark it visited.
//If something is already marked negative then this is the repeating element. To find missing, traverse the array again and look for a positive value. 
//The array gets modified, this approach is not recommended.
